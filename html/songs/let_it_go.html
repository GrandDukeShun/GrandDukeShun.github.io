<title>Let It Go</title>
</head>The snow glows white<br/>
On the mountain tonight<br/>
Not a footprint to be seen<br/>
A kingdom of isolation<br/>
And it looks like I'm the Queen<br/>
The wind is howling<br/>
Like this swirling storm inside<br/>
Couldn't keep it in<br/>
Heaven knows I tried...<br/>
Don't let them in<br/>
Don't let them see<br/>
Be the good girl you always have to be<br/>
Conceal<br/>
Don't feel<br/>
Don't let them know...<br/>
Well, now they know<i>!</i><br/>
Let it go, let it go<br/>
Can't hold it back anymore<br/>
Let it go, let it go<br/>
Turn away and slam the door<i>!</i><br/>
I don't care what they're going to say<br/>
Let the storm rage on<br/>
The cold never bothered me anyway<br/>
It's funny how some distance<br/>
Makes everything seem small<br/>
And the fears that once controlled me<br/>
Can't get to me at all<i>!</i><br/>
It's time to see<br/>
What I can do<br/>
To test the limits and break through<br/>
No right, no wrong<br/>
No rules for me<br/>
I'm free<i>!</i><br/>
Let it go<i>!</i> Let it go<i>!</i><br/>
I am one with the wind and sky<i>!</i><br/>
Let it go<i>!</i> Let it go<i>!</i><br/>
You'll never see me cry<i>!</i><br/>
Here I stand and here I'll stay<br/>
Let the storm rage on...<br/>
My power flurries through the air into the ground<br/>
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around<br/>
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast<br/>
I'm never going back<br/>
The past is in the past<i>!</i><br/>
Let it go<i>!</i> Let it go<i>!</i><br/>
And I'll rise like the break of dawn<i>!</i><br/>
Let it go<i>!</i> Let it go<i>!</i><br/>
That perfect girl is gone<i>!</i><br/>
Here I stand in the light of day...<br/>
Let the storm rage on<i>!!!</i><br/>
The cold never bothered me anyway
